# Two-Sample-Hotellings-T2-test

Hotellings T2 statistics is a generalization of students t-test. And it is transformed to F-Dsitribution for comparing the results 

Students t test is used when we have to compare means of the sample when their population follows a normal distribution (univariate population)
whereas, 

Hotellings T2 test is used when we have to compare means(It would be a vector of means) of the sample when their population follows multivariate normal 
distribution (multivariate population)

This repository consists of R script and one text file(from which data is extracted) and one data file
There are two examples in which Two sample Hotellings T2 is used to compare the means of two multivariate populations
